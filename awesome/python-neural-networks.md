https://code.google.com/p/neurolab/ Neurolab is a simple and powerful Neural Network Library for Python. Contains based neural networks, train algorithms and flexible framework to create and explore other networks. It has the following features: pure python + numpy; API like Neural Network Toolbox (NNT) from MATLAB; interface to use train algorithms form scipy.optimize; flexible network configurations and learning algorithms; and a variety of supported types of Artificial Neural Network and learning algorithms.

http://ffnet.sourceforge.net/ ffnet is a fast and easy-to-use feed-forward neural network training solution for python. Many nice features are implemented: arbitrary network connectivity, automatic data normalization, very efficient (also parallel) training tools, network export to fortran code.

http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/ Fast Artificial Neural Network Library is a free open source neural network library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in both fixed and floating point are supported. It includes a framework for easy handling of training data sets. It is easy to use, versatile, well documented, and fast. Bindings to more than 15 programming languages are available. An easy to read introduction article and a reference manual accompanies the library with examples and recommendations on how to use the library. Several graphical user interfaces are also available for the library.

PyBrain is a modular Machine Learning Library for Python. Its goal is to offer flexible, easy-to-use yet still powerful algorithms for Machine Learning Tasks and a variety of predefined environments to test and compare your algorithms.PyBrain is short for Python-Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network Library. In fact, we came up with the name first and later reverse-engineered this quite descriptive "Backronym".

http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. 

http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/
PyNN (pronounced 'pine') is a simulator-independent language for building neuronal network models.
In other words, you can write the code for a model once, using the PyNN API and the Python programming language, and then run it without modification on any simulator that PyNN supports (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM and Brian).
